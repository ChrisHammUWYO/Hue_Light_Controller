# Hue_Light_Controller
An HTML5/Javascript application that lets you control the Philips Hue Lights around the house. This is a working product that uses JSON requests to communicate with the Bridge. 

To run the Application, double-click on the 'Homepage_r3.html' file. Make sure that the files 'Hue_Light_Controller_CSS.css' and 'Hue_Light_JS_Functions.js' are in the same folder as the Homepage_r3 file, or else the application will not function correctly.
